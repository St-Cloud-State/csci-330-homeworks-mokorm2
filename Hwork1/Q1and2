QUESTION 2

Q6 Answer- Unix is mostly written in C. 
Q7 Answer- Too many features in a language, especially in a language that not many programmers are familiar with, can lead to the neglect of most features in a familiar language and never using an unfamiliar language, even if it has useful features. 
Q8 Answer- The Readability of a program can be harmed by user-defined operator overloading if they do it non-sensibly. 
Q9 Answer- one example of a lack of orthogonality in C are its rules and exceptions when it comes to its data types, arrays and records. 
Q10 Answer- ALGOL 68 
Q11 Answer- Special words 
Q12 Answer- a program is reliable if it performs to its specifications under all conditions. 
Q13 Answer- Type checking the parameters of a subprogram is important because without it the type of parameter in a function call won't be checked to determine whether its type matched that of the corresponding formal parameter in the function. 
Q14 Answer- Aliasing is having two or more distinct names in a program that can be used to access the same memory cell. 
Q15 Answer- exception handling is the ability of a program to interpret run-time errors (as well as other unusual conditions detectable by the program), take corrective measures, and then continue. 
Q16 Answer- both readability and writability influence reliability. Readability affects reliability in both the writing and maintenance phases. 

Q20 Answer- incompleteness of type checking and inadequacy of control statements. 
Q21 Answer- Inheritance, data abstraction, and Dynamic (run-time) method binding  
Q22 Answer- Smalltalk was a foundational part of object-oriented programming, fully embracing and implementing OOP principles. Simula was the first to introduce the fundamental concepts of OOP. 
Q23 Answer- reliability and cost of execution 
Q24 Answer- compiler implementation, pure interpretation, and Hybrid implementation systems 
Q25 Answer- compiler 

Q29 Answer- pure interpretation has the advantage of allowing easy implementation of many source-level debugging operations
